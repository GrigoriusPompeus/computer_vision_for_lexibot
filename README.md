**Developed as part of DECO3801 - Design Computing Studio 3**

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Want to see artwork detection in action? Follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Python 3.8+** and ensure you have a working webcam
2. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:GrigoriusPompeus/computer_vision_for_lexibot.git

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Webcam or camera device
- MQTT broker (optional, for robot integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:GrigoriusPompeus/computer_vision_for_lexibot.git
   cd computer_vision_for_lexibot
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # Linux/Mac
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🎮 How to Run

### 1. Main Real-time Detection Application
**This is the primary application for live artwork detection:**
```bash
python scripts/real_time_detection.py
```
- Opens your camera and displays live detection results
- Shows bounding boxes around detected artworks with confidence scores
- Estimates distance to detected objects
- Press **ESC** or click **EXIT** button to quit

### 2. Test Your Camera Setup
**Run this first to ensure your camera is working:**
```bash
python test_camera.py
```
- Simple camera test to verify your webcam functionality
- Press **ESC** to exit

### 3. Test Art Detection with Sample Images
**Test the custom model with built-in sample detection:**
```bash
python test_custom_art_detection.py
```
- Tests the custom trained model on sample images
- Great for verifying the model is working correctly
- No camera required - uses test images

### 4. MQTT Integration Demo
**For robot integration testing:**
```bash
python demo_mqtt_art.py
```
- Simulates MQTT communication for robot integration
- Shows how detection data is formatted and transmitted
- No MQTT broker required - demonstrates the data flow

### 5. Training Tools (Advanced)
**For retraining or improving the model:**
```bash
python training/train_custom_model.py
```
- Requires dataset preparation
- See training directory for setup instructions

## 🔧 Configuration

### Camera Settings
- **Default camera index**: 0 (first available camera)
- **Resolution**: Auto-detected from your camera
- **FPS**: 20 (adjustable in config)

### Detection Parameters

- **Model**: Custom trained `models/best.pt` (5.2 MB)
- **Input size**: 640x640 pixels
- **Classes**: 5 artworks (Mona Lisa, Starry Night, Liberty Leading People, The Scream, Sunflowers)

### Distance Estimation
The system estimates distances using computer vision techniques:
- **Focal length**: 800 pixels (calibrated for standard webcams)

    "height": 480,
    "fps": 20
  }
}
```

### MQTT Topics
- **Primary topic**: `lexibot/art_detections` - Main detection data
